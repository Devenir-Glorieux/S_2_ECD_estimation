# ECD_estimation_for_well_constraction

script for estimating hydrodynamic losses in a drilling well. The script allows you to input multiple intervals for analysis.

For each interval, you can enter the following parameters: 

- bit diameter
- average tool outside diameter
- bottom hole depth
- vertical bottom hole depth
- drilling fluid flow rate
- rheological properties (such as mud density, plastic viscosity, and yield point)
- inside diameter of the casing planned for that interval

The program then calculates and displays the Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) results for the casing shoe and the bottom of each interval. 
These results provide valuable information about the hydrodynamic losses and pressure conditions in the well during drilling operations.
